<p>Museums help to teach, inspire, and connect communities. Their
presence (or lack thereof) must influence outcomes. The content of this
website explores potential associations between the existence of museums
in a location, the educational attainment of the population, and income.
Below is a map that pins the locations of museums, aquariums, and zoos
in the United States. Clicking on a marker prompts a pop-up of the
institution name.</p>
