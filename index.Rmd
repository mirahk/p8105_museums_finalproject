Museums help to teach, inspire, and connect communities. Their presence (or lack thereof) must influence outcomes. The content of this website explores potential associations between the existence of museums in a location, the educational attainment of the population, and income. Below is a map that pins the locations of museums, aquariums, and zoos in the United States. Clicking on a marker prompts a pop-up of the institution name.
